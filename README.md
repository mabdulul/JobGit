# GitHub Jobs API frontend me

## Introduction

>This is frontendmentor project. This is a fully functional job board using the GitHub Jobs API and it is fully responsive. I also used React hooks. This application allows users to search for tech jobs.

## Code Samples

> STACK
* React
* HTML/CSS

# Purpose and Goal
I built this project to become familiar with the react hook useReducer. I also wanted to get better at translating a Figma design to code and get used to the thought process. Furthermore, this project introduced me to CSS Grid.

# Problems/Solutions
The main problem I had with my code it was too repetitive. I had too many functions calling the GitHub API. Decreasing my repetition was one of my main goals for this project. I solved this issue by using useReducer and creating my own react hook. I also had a CORS issue. I resolve this by creating a proxy with Netlify Functions.

## Installation

* npm install 
* npm start
